This is a very bare-bones project for a rogue-liek game. There is implemantation of saving/loading data, managing an inventory, and fighting enemies. 
I have to say that it is a bit wonky sometimes, but it mostly works, for the exception of healing.
The game is very hard because it is based on only luck for now.
Hope you enjoy it!
