This is a very bare-bones project for a rogue-like game. There is implemantation of saving/loading data, managing an inventory, and fighting enemies. 
I have to say that it is a bit wonky sometimes, but it mostly works as intended.
The game is very difficult to progress through because it is based on only luck for now.
Hope you enjoy it!

LORE
The world has turned upside down. Mythological creatures are crawling from the abyss, looking to reclaim their lost lands. Nothing looks normal anymore - the fields you knew 
so well have turned into caricatures of classical Korean artistry. You do not know why, but you do know that you should never stop fighting for your survival. Survive 
encounters with gwishins (venegeful ghosts), gumihos (nine-tailed foxes), Daltokki (moon rabbits), Yong (water dragons), and death itself, Jeosung Saja, because it is the only
path you know, so your existence proves to be somehow meaningful.

IMPLEMENTATION
Events - the parent class of Enemy, Treasure, and Fountain
Enemy - consists of Gwishin, Gumiho, Daltokki, Yong, and Jeosung Saja, each with two different attacks
Treasure - gives the player an item
Fountain - heals the player
Items - most importantly, they have a name and an effectm determined by a gimmick. They consist of four weapons (spears), a consumabkle healing potion, and a consumbeable power-up potion.
